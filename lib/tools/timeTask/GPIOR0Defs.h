 * The bit defined by #GPIOR0_INDEX_BIT serves an array index (which can only
 * be 0 or 1) into an internally managed array timeTask_uptime[2]. This array,
 * keeping the current and the previous uptime, and the index bit are written
 * asynchronously in interrupt context. This information is used by the
 * #TIMETASK macro when reading the current uptime in milliseconds. With this
 * double buffering, there is no need to disable interrupts in main context
 * when reading from the array, as access to the array index is atomic.
