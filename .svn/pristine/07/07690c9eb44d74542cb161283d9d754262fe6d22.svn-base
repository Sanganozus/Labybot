 *
 * Library for interfacing with AD converter.
 *
 * The AD converter library supports a moving average filter for each sampled
 * channel. Configuration of the AD converter library is included in
 * src/cfg/io/adc/adc_cfg.h where size of the moving average filter
 * (#ADC_FILTER_SIZE), number of channels to be sampled (#ADC_CHANNEL_COUNT) and
 * specification of channels (#ADC_CHANNEL_INIT) is given.
 *
 * After calling ADC_init() the ADC is setup to sample all given channels
 * consecutively using the ADC complete interrupt. The ADC clock is set to a
 * frequency of 62.5kHz which is the lowest possible frequency resulting in the
 * least noise of sampled values. The first conversion takes 25 ADC clock cycles
 * (400us). All following conversions take 13 ADC clock cycles each (208us).
 *
 * Starting a conversion is triggered through timer 5 compare match ISR
 * <code>TIMER5_COMPA_vect</code> (see lib/tools/timeTask/timeTask_isr.S) every
 * two milliseconds. As soon as a conversion is finished (after 208us or 400us),
 * the ADC complete ISR <code>ADC_vect</code> (see lib/io/adc/adc_isr.S) is
 * executed which reads the converted value and stores it in a data structure
 * which contains the sampled values for each channel and their average value.
 * The ISR then sets up the ADC for the conversion of the next channel which
 * will be triggered by the next run of <code>TIMER5_COMPA_vect</code>.
 * So every two milliseconds, a single channel is sampled. This means that the
 * frequency of sampling each channel depends on the number of overall channels
 * to be sampled. Thus, each channel is sampled every #ADC_CHANNEL_COUNT * 2ms,
 * see #ADC_SAMPLING_INTERVAL.
 *
 * Note that the bit defined by #GPIOR0_ADC_BIT (see lib/tools/timeTask/GPIOR0Defs.h)
 * of the register GPIOR0 serves as a flag for <code>TIMER5_COMPA_vect</code>
 * to check whether ADC conversions need to be enabled. This flag is modified by
 * ADC_init(), ADC_resume() and ADC_pause().
 *
 * The latest sampled raw value for a given channel can be requested with
 * ADC_getLastValue(). Note that the age of this value is in the
 * worst case about #ADC_CHANNEL_COUNT * 2ms plus the conversion time of the
 * ADC (208us after the first conversion).
 *
 * The filtered sample can be read with ADC_getFilteredValue().
 * This is a result of applying a moving average filter to the latest
 * #ADC_FILTER_SIZE samples. Note that the first meaningful value can be
 * obtained after the ADC has sampled a channel at least #ADC_FILTER_SIZE times.
 * Thus, measured from the time when ADC_init() was called and interrupts were
 * globally enabled, the first readout of the filtered value should occur no
 * earlier than (#ADC_FILTER_SIZE * #ADC_CHANNEL_COUNT * 2ms), see
 * #ADC_FILTER_FILL_TIME.
 *
 * Note that filtering introduces a time delay. The group delay of the moving
 * average filter is exactly (#ADC_FILTER_SIZE - 1) / 2 samples or
 * (#ADC_FILTER_SIZE - 1) / 2 * #ADC_CHANNEL_COUNT * 2ms.
 *
 * The JTAG interface is enabled by default up on a power cycle. When enabled,
 * the pins PF4 to PF7 (TCK, TMS, TDO, TDI) which also have the alternate
 * functions ADC4 to ADC7 can only be used for the JTAG interface. In this
 * situation all these pins are pulled high by the hardware and cannot be used
 * by the ADC.
 *
 * In order to allow their usage by the ADC, the JTAG can be switched off by
 * calling ADC_init() with the argument true. The JTD bit of the register MCUCR
 * is then used to turn off the JTAG interface.
