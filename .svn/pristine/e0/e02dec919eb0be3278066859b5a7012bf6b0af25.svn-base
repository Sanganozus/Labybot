/**
 * @file pathFollower.h
 * @ingroup pathFollower
 *
 * Implementation of a path follower which interfaces with HWPCS.
 * Additionally, the path follower can be controlled directly by functions
 * such as pathFollower_setNewPath() and pathFollower_command().
 *
 * The path follower internally manages two states of type PathFollowerStatus_t
 * and PathFollowerExtStatus_t. These states are updated by calls to
 * pathFollower_update(). The current state can be acquired with
 * pathFollower_getStatus() and pathFollower_getExtStatus().
 *
 * In order to have HWPCS reflect the recent state and update the Scene view accordingly,
 * the state returned by pathFollower_getStatus() must be sent regularly
 * to HWPCS.
 *
 * You are welcome to modify the path follower according to your needs.
 *
 * When compiling with the symbol PATHFOLLOWER_QUIET defined, no informational
 * messages are sent to HWPCS. This includes information when a path has been
 * set, following is started, paused or reset, path following parameters are
 * set, end of path is reached and a switch to another segment occurs. Only
 * error messages (such as when a path can not be set or when the path follower
 * cannot find the orthogonal projection or lookahead point) are transmitted to
 * HWPCS. PATHFOLLOWER_QUIET saves 428 bytes of flash memory and 32 bytes of
 * SRAM.
 *
 * The error messages can be suppressed when additionally compiling with the
 * symbol PATHFOLLOWER_REALLY_QUIET defined (only applicable if
 * PATHFOLLOWER_QUIET is defined as well).
 * PATHFOLLOWER_REALLY_QUIET additionally saves 278 bytes of flash memory.

 * when the path follower is paused.
 *
 * The callback function is invoked from the communication callback function which

 *
 * Registering the callback function <code>cbf()</code> can be done by

 * from the current robot position and the path (either received by the
 * communication protocol or manually set by pathFollower_setNewPath()) in case
 * path following is enabled.
 *
 * This function should be called from <code>main()</code> context in regular intervals.
 *
 * The function operates in two steps:
 * 1. First, the location of the orthogonal projection of the current pose onto the path
 *    is determined. The function determines, starting from the current segment (in
 *    PathFollowerStatus_t.segStart and PathFollowerStatus_t.segEnd) along subsequent
 *    path segments, which orthogonal projection of the current position onto the
 *    segments has smallest distance to the current position. In order to keep
 *    execution time acceptable and also to avoid taking shortcuts (or skipping
 *    too many segments) in case of concave or crossing paths, the number of
 *    consecutive segments examined is limited by the value supplied to
 *    pathFollower_setSegmentLimit().
 * 2. Once the location of the orthogonal projection is found in step 1, the
 *    location of the lookahead point is determined by advancing the distance
 *    given by pathFollower_setLookaheadDistance() along the path, even over
 *    multiple segments if necessary.
 *
 * If the function returns true, a controller should generate control inputs for
 * approaching the lookahead point.
 * If the function returns false, the robot should stop and no further control
 * inputs should be applied.
 *
 * Use timeTask_getTimestamp() and timeTask_getDuration() timeTask_getDuration()
 * to measure the execution time of this function as it depends heavily on the
 * values given by pathFollower_setSegmentLimit() and
 * pathFollower_setLookaheadDistance(). Note that the first run of
 * pathFollower_update() after a new path has been set takes much longer than
 * following runs since several internal variables need to be initialized.
 *
 * @param   currentPose   current pose of the robot
 * @return  true if the internally managed state structures were updated and
 *               following is still enabled,
 *          false if following was disabled in case of reaching the path's end
