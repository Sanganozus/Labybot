/**

 * @ingroup tools
 *
 * Functions for timed execution of code and measurement of execution time.
 *
 * Timer 5 is used for measuring the uptime. Its output compare match ISR
 * <code>TIMER5_COMPA_vect</code> is fired every millisecond.
 *
 * Note that the ISR <code>TIMER5_COMPA_vect</code> also has the responsibility
 * of starting AD conversions if the ADC library has been initialized by
 * ADC_init(). See lib/io/adc/adc.h for further details.
 *
 * Several bits of the register GPIOR0 are used for different purposes. The
 * bits are defined in lib/tools/timeTask/GPIOR0Defs.h.
 * - The bit defined by #GPIOR0_ADC_BIT determines if the ADC has been initialized
 *   and is activated (modified by ADC_init(), ADC_pause() and ADC_resume()).
 *   If this flag is set, ADC conversions are triggered by the ISR
 *   <code>TIMER5_COMPA_vect</code>.
 * - The bit defined by #GPIOR0_INIT_BIT serves as a flag which determinesb
 *   if timeTask_init() has already been called in order to prevent multiple
 *   initializations.
 * - The bit defined by #GPIOR0_INDEX_BIT serves an array index (which can only
 *   be 0 or 1) into an internally managed array timeTask_uptime[2]. This array,
 *   keeping the current and the previous uptime, and the index bit are written
 *   asynchronously in interrupt context. This information is used by the
 *   #TIMETASK macro when reading the current uptime in milliseconds. With this
 *   double buffering, there is no need to disable interrupts in main context
 *   when reading from the array, as access to the array index is atomic.
 *
 * The register GPIOR0 is cleared during startup by placing appropriate code
 * into the .init3 section.
