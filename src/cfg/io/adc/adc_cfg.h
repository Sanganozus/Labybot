 * ADC and starting a conversion.
 *
 * This value is internally used by TIMER5_COMPA_vect (timer 5 compare match
 * interrupt, see lib/tools/timeTask/timeTask_isr.S) to start the conversion
 * of the next channel every two milliseconds.
 *
 * The configuration is as follows:
 * - single conversion mode
 * - single-ended inputs
 * - ADC complete interrupt is enabled
 * - prescaler of 128 results into a ADC clock frequency of 62.500kHz
 *   + normal ADC conversion takes 13 ADC clock cycles, i.e. 208us for a single channel
 *   + first ADC conversion takes 25 ADC clock cycles, i.e. 400us
