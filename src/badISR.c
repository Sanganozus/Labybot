/**
 * By default, undefined ISRs have the common implementation to abort the program,
 * i.e. the microcontroller executes an infinite loop. Thus, if an interrupt fires
 * for which no ISR has been defined, the program would terminate without giving
 * some feedback to the user.
 *
 * With BADISR_vect, an implementation for all undefined ISRs can be given, which
 * effectively serves as a catch-all. The corresponding ISR is executed whenever
 * an interrupt fires which has no ISR explicitly defined in the code.
 *
 * This implementation just enters an infinite loop and toggles both LEDs
 * alternately with a delay of 100ms in order to give the user a feedback.
